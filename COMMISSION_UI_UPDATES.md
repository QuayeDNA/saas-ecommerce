    <>
      <Spinner size="sm" className="mr-2" />
      <span>Expiring...</span>
    </>

      toast.addToast(
        `Successfully expired ${result.data.expiredCount} commission(s) totaling GH₵${result.data.totalAmount}`,
        "success"
      );
      loadAllData(); // Refresh data
    } else {
      toast.addToast("Failed to expire commissions", "error");
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Failed to expire commissions:", error);
    toast.addToast("Failed to expire old commissions", "error");
