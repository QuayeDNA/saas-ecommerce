# Favicon Instructions

To complete the favicon setup, you need to generate proper favicon files. Here's how to generate them:

1. Create a high-resolution logo (at least 512x512 pixels)
2. Visit a favicon generator website like [favicon.io](https://favicon.io/) or [realfavicongenerator.net](https://realfavicongenerator.net/)
3. Upload your logo and generate the favicon package
4. Place the generated files in your `/public` directory:
   - favicon.ico
   - favicon-16x16.png
   - favicon-32x32.png
   - apple-touch-icon.png
   - android-chrome-192x192.png
   - android-chrome-512x512.png
   - safari-pinned-tab.svg
   - mstile-150x150.png

## Alternative (If you're not ready to create custom favicons)

You can use a temporary favicon by following these steps:

1. Download a free icon from a site like [Flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/)
2. Use an online converter to create the various sizes
3. Place them in your `/public` directory

## Important Note

Make sure your `og-image.png` (for social media sharing) is:
- At least 1200x630 pixels
- Clear and visually appealing
- Contains your logo and possibly a tagline
